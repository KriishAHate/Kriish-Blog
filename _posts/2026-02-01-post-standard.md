It is with deep sadness that I learned of the passing of Sir Mark Tully on January 25, 2026. For those unfamiliar with this giant of journalism, Mark Tully was the BBC's New Delhi bureau chief for 22 years , and his voice became synonymous with India itself for generations of listeners worldwide.

What drew me to Mark Tully's work wasn't just his journalism—it was his unique ability to tell India's story with nuance, empathy, and a deep understanding that few foreign correspondents have ever achieved. He was a passionate railway enthusiast who presented "Steam's Indian Summer," a documentary produced by Nick Lera in his World Steam Classics series , and this particular work remains one of my most cherished pieces of his legacy.

## A Narrative Style Ahead of His Time

Mark Tully's style of narration was something truly special. Where others saw headlines, he saw human stories. Where others rushed to judgment, he paused to understand. His journalism was marked by honesty and in my opinion his fanstistic command over english helped him in coming up with pretty accurate narations for a western audience which i feel very few journalists manage to do so today. 

His work on "Steam's Indian Summer" exemplified this perfectly. As Tully reported, he and producer Nick Lera travelled around India together locating and filming steam trains, often unsure where steam trains were still operating . It wasn't just about the locomotives—it was about the people, the culture, the changing face of India, and the preservation of heritage in a rapidly modernizing world.

## Exploring His Work

If you've never experienced Mark Tully's journalism, I encourage you to seek out his documentaries. Some of his most notable works include:

- **["Steam's Indian Summer"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdKzSDlO3pA)** - The World Steam Classics documentary
- **["Great Railway Journeys: Karachi to The Khyber Pass"](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x22p13q)** (1994) - BBC documentary

I've linked both documentaries above so you can experience his incredible narration and storytelling firsthand. These are beautiful pieces of work that capture not just the trains, but the soul and spirit of the subcontinent during transformative periods.

## Final Thoughts

Mark Tully shaped international understanding of India during several crucial decades . For me personally, his work opened my eyes to the complexity, beauty, and depth of a nation and its people. 
Rest in peace, Mark Tully.
