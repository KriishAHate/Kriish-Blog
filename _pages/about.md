I’m Kriish Hate — an automotive enthusiast with an affinity for all things mechanical. I make furniture, build, repair, and restore motorcycles, and in my spare time write here about cars, my projects, my research, and just about anything else under the roof. This blog is my digital archive of experiences, learning, and the things I follow — a place to share my point of view and, hopefully, inspire others to see the world through it.
